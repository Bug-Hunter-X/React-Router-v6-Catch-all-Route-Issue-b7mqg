This repository demonstrates a common issue with catch-all routes ("/*") in React Router v6 when used as a direct child of the `<Routes>` component.  The catch-all route is intended to match any URL that doesn't match other defined routes, acting as a 404 Not Found page. However, in this example, the catch-all route never matches, even when navigating to a non-existent URL. The solution shows how to correctly implement a catch-all route.
